Greetings! 

I am an undergraduate student at Keble College, University of Oxford, pursuing a Master of Mathematics and Statistics. I am currently in the final year of this four-year integrated program, which culminates in a dissertation project.

My interest lies in the intersection of statistics and biology, with a specific focus on developing statistical methods to address challenges in healthcare. My goal is to contribute to advancements in medical science.

I am seeking opportunities to pursue a PhD after my graduation in June 2024, intending to further explore the field of statistics and its applications in biology.

#### More about myself
I have had a diverse array of interests throughout my life. In primary school, I engaged in competitive programming and found joy in constructing model airplanes and ships. During my A-levels, I was obsessed in mechanics and cosmology, thanks to my physics teacher.

Additionally, I enjoy taking photographs (though I'm not a professional). I own a Fujifilm XT-4, along with a couple lenses: XF33mmF1.4, XF70-300mmF4-5.6, and XF16-80mmF4. You may view some of my photos [here](/photos).
