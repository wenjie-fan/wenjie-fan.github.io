Unlike dynamic sites, static websites are easier to build and maintain. In construction, one uses MarkDown files for pages, and YAML for configuration files. Some of the codes require HTML, e.g. adjusting the images. Hugo will generates all the files into HTML for publish. After construction, one needs deployment to publish, either by GitHub page, or services like Netlify. Static websites would be troublesome in updating, or realising some functions such as ecommerce. However, it's enough and suitable for building personal pages or academic pages. 
<br/> <br/>
The website (this one you are viewing) is built with a static page generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), using a [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme, and the form is powered by Formspree. The site majorly includes academic information about myself, and a gallery presenting selected photos taken by myself (one can enter from the menu above). The Favicon was drawn by my girlfriend : )
