The three-body problem is one of the most well-known problems in classic mechanics, which has no closed form solutions. However, when we assume that the third body is much smaller in mass than the other stars, it would be much easier for us to investigate more properties including the trajectory.
 
This is a tiny project when just graduating from high school. During the project we analysed the forbidden region and trajectories under different initial speeds starting from Lagrange points. The gif on the right is an example of trajectory. The third body in the restricted problem can be considered as a spaceship, and therefore we would get for example the critical speed of space travel between two stars.
