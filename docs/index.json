[{"content":" Principal component analysis (PCA) is frequently used for the visualization and unsupervised clustering of mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics data. However, there is no intuitive method to handle missing values, and the intricate structure of experimental design is often neglected. A typical example is data from biological experiments with replicate structure, which displays both variations and correlations among replicates, and suffers from incomplete observations. Probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) recovers missing values soundly within a probabilistic framework, yet it still overlooks the replicate-wise variations.\nIn this study, we extend PPCA to be conscious of the replicated model for MS data with replicated structures and possibly broader. We present two distinct inference approaches: one focuses on the likelihood model by the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, while the other lies in the Bayesian framework employing the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Our findings indicate that both approaches yield more nuanced analyses, some aspects of which have previously been ignored by researchers. The likelihood-centric approach hints replicates that may be unsuitable for PCA and tackles the challenge of missing values. In contrast, the Bayesian approach provides insightful visualizations, quantifies clustering uncertainty, and determines the risk-minimizing clustering rule.

However, sometimes the film can be stretched for more than 2 times in length, and the stress actually oscillates. The obvious manifestation is a pattern consists of opaque and translucent stripes, shown as the gif on the right. This region is what we called \u0026ldquo;neck\u0026rdquo;, which has smaller width and thickness than the undeformed part. Our main purpose is to predict the stress-strain curve when stretching a polymer film, as well as for which parameters there will be such an oscillation. The following report will include the model and the numerical scheme to this problem. The slides (extracting from the report) are used to present findings and propose future experiments to Dr. Chaoying Wan, Warwick Manufacturing Group.

However, when we assume that the third body is much smaller in mass than the other stars, it would be much easier for us to investigate more properties including the trajectory. This is a tiny project when just graduating from high school. During the project we analysed the forbidden region and trajectories under different initial speeds starting from Lagrange points. The gif on the right is an example of trajectory. The third body in the restricted problem can be considered as a spaceship, and therefore we would get for example the critical speed of space travel between two stars.
